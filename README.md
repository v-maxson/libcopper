# Copper
A simple utility library for C11.

```
Note: This library was written for my own personal needs, and may
not be suitable for all use-cases. In addition, this library is quite unstable, I would highly recommend using more hardened libraries that do similar things.

## Features
- Rust-inspired type aliases for common primitive types (`i8`, `u8`, etc.)
- Rust-inspired optional/result types.
- ...more added as needed...
